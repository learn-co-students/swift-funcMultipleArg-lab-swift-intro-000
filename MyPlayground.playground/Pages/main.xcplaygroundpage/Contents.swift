/*: question1
 ### 1. Create a function that will take in a continent and the number of countries in that continent. It should print the following sentence "____ is a continent which contains ___ countries".
 */
func continentCountries (list continent: String, numberOf countries: Int) {
    print("\(continent) is a continent which contains \(countries) countries.")
}

continentCountries(list: "Africa", numberOf: 8)

/*: question2
 ### 2. Can you see why the code below doesn't work? Fix the function call to get rid of the error.
 */
func greeting(name: String, greeting: String) {
    print("\(greeting), \(name)!")
}

greeting(name: "Danny", greeting: "Hello")




/*: question3
 ### 3. This function doesn't work, either. Can you fix the function (_not_ the call) so that it works?
 */
func daysInMonth(month: String, days: Int) {
    print("There are \(days) days in \(month)")
}

daysInMonth(month: "November", days: 30)




/*: question4
 ### 4. So far, you have created functions that take two arguments. Can you create (and call) one that takes three? Try to create a function that three parameters: a beverage, the number of bottles of that beverage, and a place you can keep those bottles. Print the sentence "____ bottles of ____ on the ____ wall."
 */
func sillySong (numberBottles: Int, favorite beverage: String, storage: String) {
    print("\(numberBottles) bottles of \(beverage) on the \(storage) wall.")
}

var numbottles = 99
var beverage = "huge"
var storage = "big"

sillySong(numberBottles: numbottles, favorite: beverage, storage: storage)

numbottles = 37
beverage = "Sprite"
storage = "little"

sillySong(numberBottles: numbottles, favorite: beverage, storage: storage)

/*: question1
 ### 1. Create a function that will take in a continent and the number of countries in that continent. It should print the following sentence "____ is a continent which contains ___ countries".
 */
// write your code here
func countriesAndContinents (continentName: String, noOfCountries: Int) {
print ("\(continentName) is a continent which contains \(noOfCountries) countries.")

}
let continent = "Africa"
let countriesInContinent = 54
countriesAndContinents(continentName: continent, noOfCountries: countriesInContinent)

/*: question2
 ### 2. Can you see why the code below doesn't work? Fix the function call to get rid of the error.
 */
func greeting(name: String, greeting: String) {
    print("\(greeting), \(name)!")
}

greeting(name: "Danny", greeting: "Hello")




/*: question3
 ### 3. This function doesn't work, either. Can you fix the function (_not_ the call) so that it works?
 */
func daysInMonth(month: String, days: String) {
    print("There are \(days) in \(month)")
}

daysInMonth(month: "November", days: "30")




/*: question4
 ### 4. So far, you have created functions that take two arguments. Can you create (and call) one that takes three? Try to create a function that three parameters: a beverage, the number of bottles of that beverage, and a place you can keep those bottles. Print the sentence "____ bottles of ____ on the ____ wall."
 */
// write your code here

func beverage (beverageName: String, beverageBottlesNumber: Int, beverageStorageLocation: String) {
    print ("\(beverageBottlesNumber) bottles of \(beverageName) on the \(beverageStorageLocation).")
}
beverage(beverageName: "Henessey", beverageBottlesNumber: 16, beverageStorageLocation: "Table")

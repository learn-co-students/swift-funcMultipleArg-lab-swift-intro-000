/*: question1
 ### 1. Create a function that will take in a continent and the number of countries in that continent. It should print the following sentence "____ is a continent which contains ___ countries".
 */
func continentdesc(continent: String, number: Int) {
    print("\(continent) is a continent which contains \(number) countries")
}

continentdesc("Europe", number: 60)





/*: question2
 ### 2. Can you see why the code below doesn't work? Fix the function call to get rid of the error.
 */
func greeting(name: String, greeting: String) {
    print("\(greeting), \(name)!")
}

greeting("Danny", greeting: "Hello")






/*: question3
 ### 3. This function doesn't work, either. Can you fix the function (_not_ the call) so that it works?
 */
func daysInMonth(month: String, days: String) {
    print("There are \(days) in \(month)")
}

daysInMonth("November", days: "thirty")




/*: question4
 ### 4. So far, you have created functions that take two arguments. Can you create (and call) one that takes three? Try to create a function that three parameters: a beverage, the number of bottles of that beverage, and a place you can keep those bottles. Print the sentence "____ bottles of ____ on the ____ wall."
 */
func beverageOnWall(number: Int, type: String, place: String) {
    print("\(number) bottles of \(type) on the \(place) wall")
}

beverageOnWall(10, type: "rum", place: "back")

var number = 3
var type = "water"
var place = "far"

beverageOnWall(number, type: type, place: place)

/*: question1
 ### 1. Create a function that will take in a continent and the number of countries in that continent. It should print the following sentence "____ is a continent which contains ___ countries".
 */
// write your code here
func countryCount(countries: String, continent: String ) {
    print("\(continent) is a continent which contains \(countries) countries")
}

countryCount(countries: "3", continent: "North America")

/*: question2
 ### 2. Can you see why the code below doesn't work? Fix the function call to get rid of the error.
 */
func greeting(name: String, greeting: String) {
    print("\(greeting), \(name)!")
}

//Forgot the external variable name
greeting(name: "Danny", greeting: "Hello")




/*: question3
 ### 3. This function doesn't work, either. Can you fix the function (_not_ the call) so that it works?
 */
func daysInMonth(month: String, days: String) {
    print("There are \(days) in \(month)")
}

//days is not an Integer has to be a string
daysInMonth(month: "November", days: "30")




/*: question4
 ### 4. So far, you have created functions that take two arguments. Can you create (and call) one that takes three? Try to create a function that three parameters: a beverage, the number of bottles of that beverage, and a place you can keep those bottles. Print the sentence "____ bottles of ____ on the ____ wall."
 */
// write your code here
func song( _ beverage: String, _ numberBottles: Int, _ place: String) {
    print("\(numberBottles) bottles of \(beverage) on the \(place).")
}

song("soda", 99, "table")

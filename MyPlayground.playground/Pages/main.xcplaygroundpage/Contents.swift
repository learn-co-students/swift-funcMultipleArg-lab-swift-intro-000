/*: question1
 ### 1. Create a function that will take in a continent and the number of countries in that continent. It should print the following sentence "____ is a continent which contains ___ countries".
 */
func countriesContinent(continent:String, country: Int){
    print("\(continent) is a continent which contains \(country) countries")
}




/*: question2
 ### 2. Can you see why the code below doesn't work? Fix the function call to get rid of the error.
 */
func greeting(name: String, greeting: String) {
    print("\(greeting), \(name)!")
}

greeting("Danny", greeting:"Hello")




/*: question3
 ### 3. This function doesn't work, either. Can you fix the function (_not_ the call) so that it works?
 */
func daysInMonth(month: String, days: Int) {
    print("There are \(days) days in \(month)")
}

daysInMonth("November", days: 30)




/*: question4
 ### 4. So far, you have created functions that take two arguments. Can you create (and call) one that takes three? Try to create a function that three parameters: a beverage, the number of bottles of that beverage, and a place you can keep those bottles. Print the sentence "____ bottles of ____ on the ____ wall."
 */
func bottlesOnTheWall(bottles:Int, variety: String, compass: String){
    print("There are \(bottles) bottles of \(variety) on the \(compass) wall!")
}

var bottle = 10
var variety = "Gin"
var compass = "North"

bottlesOnTheWall(10, variety: "Gin", compass: "North")

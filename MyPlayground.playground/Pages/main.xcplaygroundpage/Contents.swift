/*: question1
 ### 1. Create a function that will take in a continent and the number of countries in that continent. It should print the following sentence "____ is a continent which contains ___ countries".
 */
func continentDescription(continentName:String, continentCountryNum:Int){
    print("\(continentName) is a continent which contains \(continentCountryNum) countries")
}

continentDescription(continentName: "North America", continentCountryNum: 23)




/*: question2
 ### 2. Can you see why the code below doesn't work? Fix the function call to get rid of the error.
 */
func greeting(name: String, greeting: String) {
    print("\(greeting), \(name)!")
}

greeting(name: "Danny",greeting:  "Hello")




/*: question3
 ### 3. This function doesn't work, either. Can you fix the function (_not_ the call) so that it works?
 */
func daysInMonth(month: String, days: Int) {
    print("There are \(days) days in \(month).")
}

daysInMonth(month: "November", days: 30)




/*: question4
 ### 4. So far, you have created functions that take two arguments. Can you create (and call) one that takes three? Try to create a function that three parameters: a beverage, the number of bottles of that beverage, and a place you can keep those bottles. Print the sentence "____ bottles of ____ on the ____ wall."
 */
func beverageWall (beverage:String,beverageNum:Int,beveragePlace:String){
    print("\(beverageNum) bottles of \(beverage) on the \(beveragePlace) wall.")
}

beverageWall(beverage: "beer", beverageNum: 99, beveragePlace: "office")
beverageWall(beverage: "Greygoose", beverageNum: 99, beveragePlace: "fuckin")

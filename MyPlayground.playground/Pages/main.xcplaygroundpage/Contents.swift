/*: question1
 ### 1. Create a function that will take in a continent and the number of countries in that continent. It should print the following sentence "____ is a continent which contains ___ countries".
 */
func countrycounter(continent: String, contnum: Int){
    print(continent+" is a continent which contains \(contnum) countries")
}
countrycounter(continent: "North America", contnum: 3)




/*: question2
 ### 2. Can you see why the code below doesn't work? Fix the function call to get rid of the error.
 */
func greeting(name: String, greeting: String) {
    print("\(greeting), \(name)!")
}

greeting(name: "Danny", greeting: "Hello")




/*: question3
 ### 3. This function doesn't work, either. Can you fix the function (_not_ the call) so that it works?
 */
func daysInMonth(month: String, days: String) {
    print("There are \(days) in \(month)")
}

daysInMonth(month: "November", days: "30")




/*: question4
 ### 4. So far, you have created functions that take two arguments. Can you create (and call) one that takes three? Try to create a function that three parameters: a beverage, the number of bottles of that beverage, and a place you can keep those bottles. Print the sentence "____ bottles of ____ on the ____ wall."
 */
func bevCounter(beverage: String, numBott: Int, place: String){
    print("\(numBott) bottles of "+beverage+" on the "+place)
}
bevCounter(beverage: "beer", numBott: 100, place: "Wall")
